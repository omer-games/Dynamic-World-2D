# Dynamic World 2D

Dynamic World 2D is a C++ game that creates an ever-changing environment. As the player moves in different directions, the world dynamically generates new layers. Players can interact with the world by placing and breaking blocks, and even create moving spikes.

## How it Works

In Dynamic World 2D, the game world changes based on the player's movement. Each time the player moves left or right, a new layer is generated, and it's different each time even if the player retraces their steps. The game emphasizes minimal library usage, relying on just three essential libraries to deliver its dynamic environment and interactive features.
